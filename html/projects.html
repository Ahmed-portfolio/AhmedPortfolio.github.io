        <td> A car I made in computer science class that is coded to go around a certain track. I made the car from foam, motors, batteries, an experimental PCB, and an Arduino board. The hardcoded race robot was created and coded by me and a fellow classmate.<img src="../images/cs1 arduino robot.jpg" alt="Arduino race Robot" id="robot1"></td>

            This computer science project was a self driving car. It was a group project that I completed with 2 other students. I completed this project my 10th grade year of highschool. Throughout the project my role was to wire up an LCD screen, solder wires to a sensor, and attach the sensor to an arduino. I also wired 2 motors to an h-bridge on a breadboard. I aided in the beginning code for the first 2 weeks of the project. Code for the motors and sensor to work in unison was written by me. I also contributed to debugging the code that we wrote for the lcd. The final adjustments I made were directed towards our lithium polymer battery. I rewired the breadboard and arduino so that the battery became the supplier of power and no power was drawn from the arduino. I tested and adjusted the code with my group so that our turning radius for the robot was enough to turn around objects. The entire project took us 8 weeks.
